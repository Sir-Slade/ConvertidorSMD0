# ConvertidorSMD0
A tool I developed to make the edition of SMD files easier. SMD files are the type of file used in the Final Fantasy Tactics rom as
a music file. Through many bytes they encode songs so it is a tedious task to try to edit a song one byte at a time. This
project allows the user to load a SMD file and turn int into a number of instructions for they to edit and, in turn, edit the song
as they see fit. They can also create new songs from scratch. Finally the instructions are compiled and a new SMD file is made.

For the moment the files cannot be previewd unless loaded in the Final Fantasy Tactics rom.
